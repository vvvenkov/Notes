Microsoft Office is a series of tools and products 
    - experience for administrators, and experience for users (a suite of products, tools)

To manage my microsoft365 or manage my office365 environment I need to use the management portal.
    - portal.office.com
    - admin.microsoft.com

    - nothing actually resides in Office365. When we are using the admin center all we see are shortcuts to objects that exist in some of the workloads that are
     contained in Office 365, such as Active Directory, Exchange Online, SharePoint etc.
    - office 365 and Microsoft 365 we use terms interchangeably 

Cloud vs on-premises infrastructure

    On premises:
    - cost effective
    - purchase all the hardware, hire staff
    - time for upgrade expenses 

    Cloud:
    - little to no up-front costs
    - ongoing subscription
    - maintenance and upgrades are responsibility of the cloud provider

Security 

    On-premises:
    - more control
    - only internal access
    - security system is your responsibility
    - high level of security expertise in needed
    
    Cloud:
    - cloud provider is responsible for security system 
    - most providers offer comprehensive multilayered security
