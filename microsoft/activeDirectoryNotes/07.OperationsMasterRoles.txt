Operations master roles (also known as flexible single master operations, or FSMO) 
are special roles assigned to one or more domain controllers in an Active Directory domain12345.
 There are five Operations Masters in Active Directory:


Active Directory uses a multimaster replication model for object level replication
meaning I can create a user account, computer account etc. on a domain controller and it will replicate to other domain controllers 
any management of objects will also replicate to other domain controllers 

Some functions must reside on a single domain controller within the domain, others within the forest 


Forest
    - domain Naming Master - responsible for all additions and removal of domains within the forest 
    - Schema Master - holds a writable copy of the schema 
Domain 
    - RID Master - relative identifier - identifying blocks of IDs to other domain controllers within the forest
    - Infrastructure Master - updating objects that have references in other domains within the forest 
    - PDC Master - responsible for time management, all domain controllers within the domain synchronize time from the PDC master
    also responsible for updating passwords. When a password is changed in the domain, it is immediately replicated to the PDC master
