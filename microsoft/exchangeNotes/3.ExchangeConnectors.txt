    mail loop - An email loop is an unwanted chain reaction which can occur during email communication where two or more mail servers
    keep sending each other messages indefinitely. Usually it is caused by misconfigured servers, but there can also be other factors 
    involved that will be covered below. Every time a machine with pre-configured email answering receives an email message, it sends an 
    automatic reply to the sender. However, if the sender also possesses this feature, an endless loop is created between these two machines
    that will continue to send each other automatic replies indefinitely.

    typically it starts when OFfice 365 thinks a recipient doesn't exit in the service
