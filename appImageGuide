wnload the AppImage: Ensure you have the AppImage file downloaded to your system. For example, if the AppImage is called example.AppImage, make sure you know its location.

Open a terminal: Navigate to the directory where the AppImage is located, or use the absolute path.

cd /path/to/your/appimage

Make the AppImage executable: Use the chmod command to make the AppImage file executable. Run the following command in the terminal:

chmod +x example.AppImage

Replace example.AppImage with the actual name of the AppImage file.

Run the AppImage: After setting the executable permission, you can run the AppImage directly from the terminal like this:

./example.AppImage

Alternatively, you can also double-click the AppImage in your file manager to launch it, assuming your file manager supports execution of AppImage files.
