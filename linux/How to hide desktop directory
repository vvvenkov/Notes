Move the Desktop folder

    1. Open the file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs in a text editor
  
    1.1 If no present file, that means the directories haven't been added.

$sudo pacman -S xdg-user-dirs.

$xdg-user-dirs-update

  2.Change the line XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop" to point to some other location
    (for example: XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/.config/desktop")
        - Do not just remove the line:
          Doing so will make it use the default value ($HOME/Desktop) and you'll end up in the same situation that you are already in :-)
    3. Save the file
    4. Log out and back in
