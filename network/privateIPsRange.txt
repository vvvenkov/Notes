A private IP address is an IP address that's reserved for internal use behind a router or other 
Network Address Translation (NAT) device, apart from the public.
These are in contrast to public IP addresses, which are public and can't be used within a home or business network.
Sometimes a private address is also referred to as a local IP address.

Reserved IP addresses are IP addresses that are not used for communication on the internet, but for special purposes or local networks12. 
Some examples of reserved IP addresses are 127.0.0.1, which is used for loopback addresses to the local host12, and 10.0.0.0/8, which is used for local communications within a private network2.
There are several address blocks that are reserved for different scopes and functions2.
