ITTL

Seven guiding principles 

1. Focus on the value 
	- Everything we do must add value from the stakeholder's perspective.
	- Relentelss focus on value, eliminate things that don't add value to the stakeholders and amplify things that do
	
2. Start where you are
	- Obserrve directly and fully understand the current state first 
	- Don't start from scratch 

3. Progress iteratively with Feedback
	- Don't try to do everything at once
	- Organise work into smaller, manageable chunks done more often
	- Use feedback in each iteration to ensure actions are appropriate 
	- improve on outcome, not output

4. Collaborate and Promote visibillity
	- work together across boundaries for more buy-in and success
	- share information and build understanding and truse
	- make work and consequences visible 

5. Think and Work Holistically
	= work on the servicem not just it's parts 
	= Integrate information, technology, organization, people, practises, partners and agreements 
	- comes from system thinking, a concept that is heavily cited in the Devops community. De-optimize the hole by optimizing parts of the system. Work on the system, not just it's parts.

6. Keep it simple and practical
	- Eliminate anything that provides no value.
	- use the minimum number of steps to accomplish objectives
	- Use outcome-based thinking for practical solutions and results 

7. Optimize and Automate 
	- use resources, particularly human resources, to best effect 
	- another DevOps model, focus on automation 
	- Eliminate anything wasteful
	- Use technology to achieve whatever it can do
	- Only use human intervention where it adds value
