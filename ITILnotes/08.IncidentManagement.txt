Incident Management 
	- The process of handling all incidents throughout their lifecycle is known as incident management. 

Incidents are raised over the phone, email or web-based and event-management tools. 

Purpose 
	- restore normal service operations as soon as possible
	- minimise adverse impacts on business operations 
	- ensure the best possible levels of service quality and availability 

Objective 
	- standardise methods and procedures used for efficient prompt response 
	- analyse, document and report incidents during management process
	- increase visibillity and communication of incidents to business and IT support staff
	- align incident management activities and priorities with those of the business 
	
Scope 
	- Identified directly by users through service desk. 
	- identified through an interface between event management and incident management tools.
	- reported or logged by technical staff.

Value to business
	- adds value to business
	- lowers downtime for the business, which in turn leads to higher availability of the services. 
	- it allows/ enables the business to better identify priorities and dynamically allocate resources as required 
	- it increases the ability to identify potential improvements to services.

The followin SCENARIO demonstartes the importance of incident management in an organisation:

	- In the absence of incident management, issues are handled on a first-come, first-served basis. If there are 10 issues related to printing, the IT support staff are occupied with resolving those issues. At this time, if a major business service becomes unavailable, there is no IT support available to respond.

	- Alternatively, if the IT service provider uses incident management, printer calls will be low priority and fewer resources will be allocated to resolving them. This insures a high priority incident can get the needed focus and resources.
